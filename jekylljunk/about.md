This is a private site for Long River Tai Chi students.

The posts are notes taken primarily by Bari Shamas in a variety of Long River Tai Chi classes taught by Wolfe Lowenthal. They are routinely reviewed and amended by other attendees including: James, Stephanie, and sometimes Wolfe.

Life being subjective and note taking in a martial arts class being a feat not for the feint of heart or slow of hand, these notes are kept succinct and as close to the actual words of the teacher. Often this means excluding some nuance and embellishment and only hinting at the physical dynamics being examined and demonstrated in the class.
