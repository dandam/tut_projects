###Saturday May 3 Class with Wolfe
*written from notes by Bari May 6 ’14*

Root - you can’t force into root. It is about internal energy. Pressing down is a habit of tightness. Deepening root comes from correct alignment. The more you press down the more you come up out of your root.

Wolfe asks Mark to demonstrate roll back. It isn’t doing - it is understanding correct position.

Dynamics of internal strength is from squaring your hips.

Wolfe asks Henry to demonstrate roll back. Wolfe points to the right thigh and how it relaxes and drops in. Talks about how that is the art of Swimming Dragon.

Wolfe told about how he heard laughing coming from a class. And comments that when Tai Chi is going well you should be laughing.

White Crane is a circle movement

In Brush Knee, one may think it a block - we want to think about minimum force. Do the form as if there is someone there.

Meet energy and deflect it. Your entire energy system is what relates to force.

The idea of Wipe can happen in any number of places in the form

The circles in the form are big for chi development, not so much for martial application.

On Fair Lady the hand comes up and deflects with the waist turn.

Wipe is a sophisticated response. There are lots of places it can go wrong.
 * tail bone not hanging
 * resistance
 * collapsed right shoulder
 * Invest in removing rather than taking opposing force with force. There is a split second where that is all the time you need. For an effective wipe your timing has to be right. And that split second is all the time you need.

In sensing hands, Wolfe asks Roberta to demonstrate with him. He shows how her looseness helps her get into position to do the wipe, but her timing to getting the other hand under to offer the slip of hands is off. Says of the wipe - be as fierce as a tiger and greedy as a wolf.

Wolfe tells a story of Julian coming home from middle school and asks, “How do I get out of a head lock?” Wolfe asked him “how did you get in it?” In Tai Chi you don’t get in a stuck place to begin with.

Wipe has three stages
1. go with energy, rule out resistance
2. Form helps by showing when the hand crosses body is the time for the other hand
to get into position
3. this one is really hard. You don’t wipe off but take the energy away.
