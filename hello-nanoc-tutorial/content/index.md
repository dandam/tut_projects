##A Brand New nanoc Site

* So, this is nanoc. Interesting... there are so many of these frameworks, I begin to wonder what all the fuss is about. How can they all survive? How can any die? They are essentially all packages, somewhat generalized solutions, but do any of them really to anything better or different than the others. Flat site generators seem fine for content driven sites, but if you need something with a bit functionality, like say an advanced product finder, product customization tool, or even a set of authenticated forms and end-user account management... you need something more and then you're back in the land of app frameworks and you may as well build your own content templates and such there, right?</p>

# Things I Will Do Today

1. Tai Chi

3. Go pick up Prasanna and take him to the Mall of America
4. Eat lunch
5. Take Prasanna to the airport
6. On the way back from the airport I want to stop at a few stores and pick up somethings like groceries, poly bags for my records, and maybe some comic books.
7. Chill the heck out.
